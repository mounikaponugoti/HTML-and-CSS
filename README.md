# HTML-and-CSS
HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It provides the structures to the content displayed in the website. HTML can be used along with CSS and JavaScript to create visually rich and dynamic websites. </br> 
My current goal is to learn the basics of HTML and CSS (possibly JavaScript) to be able to add and modify the basic content like text, videos, and images on webpages for fun. </br>
